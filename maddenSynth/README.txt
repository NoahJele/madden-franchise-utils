This tool allows you to generate, create, and share scenarios for your Madden 24 franchise.

USAGE:
Extract the downloaded .zip to a folder of your choice, and then launch the MaddenSynth .exe file. 

First, you will have to enter the name of your franchise file. Follow the included prompts for instructions on that.

Then, once your file is loaded, you will be presented with a series of options:

- The generate scenario option will generate a scenario from the scenario list and show you the result

- The create scenario option will walk you through creating a new scenario

- The reload scenarios option will reload the scenario storage. Only use this option if you have modified or added to the files in the scenarios folder while the tool is running.

- The quit option will ask if you would like to save changes, and then exit MaddenSynth.

ADDING SCENARIOS:
There are two ways to add scenarios. You can either use the create scenario option in the tool, or you can add a properly formatted JSON file to the scenarios folder. Look at existing files for an example of how this file should be formatted.

SCENARIO RANDOM THRESHOLD:
When creating a scenario, you will be asked if you want to add a random threshold to the scenario. THis allows you to make some scenarios more rare than others. If you choose yes, you will be asked to input a random threshold. How this works is when generating a scenario, if this scenario is chosen, a random number between 1 and 50 will be generated, and for the scenario to get used, it must be greater than or equal to your chosen random threshold value.

For example, if you chose a random threshold of 45, that means you would see that scenario about once or twice every 10 times it's chosen, since 45/50 is equal to 9/10.
